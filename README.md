## üöÄ Quick Fucking Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Raspberry Pi Zero W**
- **SD Card** (8GB+ recommended)
- **Docker** for development
- Basic knowledge of RF regulations in your area (don't be a fucking idiot)

### üö® IMPORTANT: Pi Zero Setup First!

**Before you do ANYTHING else**, you need to get your fucking Pi Zero W connected and accessible via SSH. Follow this tutorial that actually fucking works:

üëâ **[Pi Zero W USB Connection Tutorial](https://ciprian.51k.eu/pi-zero-1-wh-ubuntu-24-04-usb-connection-the-tutorial-that-actually-fkin-works/)**

This will get your Pi Zero connected via USB with SSH access so you can actually deploy PIrateRF to the bastard. Don't skip this step or you'll be fucked trying to connect to your Pi later!

**Credentials setup**: During the Pi Zero setup tutorial, I used username `fucker`, hostname `piraterf.local`, password `FUCKER`. Use these same credentials if you don't want to get confused with the rest of this tutorial - otherwise go ahead and set up some lame ass shit with your own credentials.

**üåê INTERNET SHARING REQUIRED**: After USB connection is working, you MUST share internet from your computer to the Pi Zero. The setup scripts need to download packages and dependencies. Your Pi Zero connects via USB but has no internet unless you share it from your host computer.

**Set up internet sharing on Ubuntu/Linux** (complete fucking setup):

1. **Set connection to shared**: In Ubuntu Network Settings, find the USB connection (usually shows as `usb0` or similar), click on it, go to IPv4 settings, and change the method from "Link-Local Only" to "Shared to other computers". This is fucking critical!

2. **Stop Docker services** (they fuck with networking):

```bash
sudo systemctl stop docker.socket
sudo systemctl stop docker
```

3. **Restart NetworkManager**:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

4. **Configure iptables rules** (replace `usb0` and `enp5s0` with your actual interfaces):

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i usb0 -o enp5s0 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i enp5s0 -o usb0 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.42.0.0/24 -o enp5s0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
```

5. **Test it**: SSH into your Pi and run `ping 8.8.8.8` - if it works, you're fucking golden!

**Find your interfaces**: Use `ip link show` to see `usb0` (Pi connection) and your main internet interface (usually `eth0`, `wlan0`, `enp0s3`, etc.). Without this internet sharing setup, the dependency installation will fail because the Pi can't reach package repositories!

### üîå ANTENNA SETUP

Connect your fucking antenna to the Pi Zero:

**GPIO Connection**: Connect your antenna cable to **GPIO 4 (Physical Pin 7)** on the Pi Zero W. This is your RF output pin.

**Antenna Options**:

1. **Short wire** (~10-20cm): Best for indoor testing and learning. Keeps power low and legal.
2. **75cm wire**: Longer range but too much signal leaks outside your property - use this **ONLY indoors**
3. **Proper antenna with low pass filter**: Build or buy a proper antenna system with SMA connector and appropriate low pass filter for your frequency

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: The 75cm antenna is a fucking liability outdoors - your signal will travel way beyond your property and you'll be violating regulations. Stick to short wires for testing or build proper filtered antenna systems for serious use.

**‚ö†Ô∏è USE A FUCKING LOW PASS FILTER!** The Pi GPIO outputs square waves which generate harmonics across the entire spectrum. Without proper filtering, you'll spray RF energy all over the fucking place and violate spurious emission regulations. Always use an appropriate low pass filter for your transmission frequency!

### 1. Initial Pi Setup and Configuration

Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite to your SD card and enable SSH. Then:

```bash
# Clone this badass project
git clone https://github.com/psyb0t/piraterf.git
cd piraterf
```

Edit scripts/pi_config.sh and modify these values to match your Pi:

```bash
export PI_USER="fucker"              # Pi username
export PI_HOST="piraterf.local"      # Pi hostname/IP
export PI_PASS="FUCKER"             # Pi password

# WiFi AP Configuration
export AP_SSID="üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüì°"             # WiFi access point name
export AP_PASSWORD="FUCKER!!!"      # WiFi access point password
export AP_CHANNEL="7"                # WiFi channel (1-14)
export AP_COUNTRY="US"               # WiFi country code (US, UK, DE, etc.)
```

### 2. Complete Automated Setup

Run the full setup pipeline that configures everything automatically:

```bash
make pi
```

This fucking command will:

1. **Install dependencies** (rpitx, sox, ffmpeg, etc.)
2. **Configure WiFi Access Point** (SSID: "üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüì°", Password: "FUCKER!!!")
3. **Setup system branding** (MOTD, terminal aliases, pirate theme)
4. **Build and deploy** the PIrateRF application
5. **Install systemd service** for auto-start
6. **Reboot** the Pi into pirate mode

### 3. Connect and Use

After reboot:

1. **Connect to WiFi**: "üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüì°" with password "FUCKER!!!"
2. **Open browser**: Navigate to `https://piraterf.local` (or whatever hostname you configured)
3. **Start transmitting**: Upload audio, configure RDS, and broadcast like a proper pirate!

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Use the HTTPS hostname for full functionality. The fucking microphone recording feature requires HTTPS with a proper hostname to work due to browser security restrictions.

**üéâ Pirate Crew Mode**: Connect multiple devices to the same WiFi network and all access the web interface simultaneously! While only one transmission can run at a time (because GPIO doesn't fucking share), all connected devices see real-time transmission status, output logs, and can take turns controlling the RF transmissions. Perfect for fucking around with friends in a radio wave gangbang! üì°üí•

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow
